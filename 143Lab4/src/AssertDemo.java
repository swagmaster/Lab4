/*
 * 1. I like using the debugger because it seems to have more control over the execution.
 * 2. I think that there are some techniques that would be pretty specific to problems so it
 *    it would be appropriate to use different methods.
 * 3. It is very helpful visually because it shows you exactly where something isn't properly 
 *    executing.
 * 4. It is good to properly document things so that not only the coder can understand it but 
 *    someone who is reading can understand it too.
